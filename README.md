# Werewolf-2.0

Mafia as described by [wikipedia](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)>), adjusted for Werewolf:

> **Werewolf** is a party game modelling a conflict between two groups: an informed minority (the werewolves), and an uninformed majority (the villagers/town). At the start of the game, each player is secretly assigned a role affiliated with one of these teams. The game has two alternating phases: one, during which the werewolves may covertly "devour" an innocent, and two, in which surviving players debate the identities of the werewolves and vote to eliminate a suspect. The game continues until all of the werewolves have been eliminated or until the werewolves outnumbers the villagers.
